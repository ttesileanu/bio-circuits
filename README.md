# Biological circuits in PyTorch

Here we provide implementations with a common interface of various biologically plausible neural circuits. These are mainly algorithms developed within the [Chklovskii](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7Bgb5TUAAAAJ&hl=en) lab at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/).

## Installation

A [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment can be created using

    conda env create -f environment.yml

Install the package by using the following command in the main repo folder:

    pip install .

Install an editable version (useful for development) by using

    pip install -e .

## Usage

See [notebooks](notebooks) for usage examples.
